# rentsharecalculator
A small project used to calculate share of each tenant's share of rent, supposedly to be used in our flat. Also, I used this to practice Node.JS and Javascript.

Capability to generate a PNG screenshot and PDF of the share tables has been added, to make it easier to acquire files for recordkeeping and forwarding of information to other housemates. 

NODE_MODULES folder is missing here, I cannot upload it due to the file size and count.
